# An Analyis on Car Loan Interest Rates Over The Past Decade - Data Analytics Bootcamp 25' Project 1 Group 5

## Project Summary

- This project explores the factors influencing rising car loan prices in the United States between 2015 and 2025. Our analysis focuses on how macroeconomic trends, such as federal debt and inflation, contribute to increasing auto loan interest rates, while also examining shifts in consumer borrowing behavior, such as the preference for longer loan terms and rising financed amounts despite stagnant incomes.

## Data Source

- [FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)

    - Clearing up misconceptions
    - Troubleshooting code
    - Locating data
- StackOverflow provided assistance when troubleshooting code.
- Many of Python's libraries were utilized in the data processing and visualization process:
    - CSV for reading and parsing each data file.
    - Pandas for data manipulation, cleaning, and basic visualization.
    - Matplotlib for detailed and customized data visualization.
    - OS to manage file paths and ensure compatibility across different operating systems.

## Key Findings

### Federal Debt 
Drives Up Auto Loan Interest Rates: Rising federal debt increases inflation expectations, prompting higher nominal interest rates on auto loans.
### Two-Year Lag in Interest Rate Impact: 
Thereâ€™s a notable delay of approximately two years between federal debt increases and corresponding spikes in car loan interest rates, due to economic absorption and delayed Federal Reserve responses.
### Stagnant Incomes Amid Growing Debt: 
Median household income has plateaued while federal debt continues to rise, reducing consumers' ability to manage higher loan costs.
### Shift Toward Longer Loan Terms: 
Consumers are increasingly opting for longer loan terms (e.g., 72 months), which often come with higher interest rates and lead to increased total borrowing costs.
### Increasing Financed Amounts Despite Income Plateau: 
Even as incomes stagnate, the average amount financed per car loan continues to rise, suggesting a growing reliance on debt and higher debt-to-income ratios.
